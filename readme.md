<h1>Skyline CSS Practice</h1>
This code was created as part of the www.FreeCodeCamp.org 's "Responsive Web Design" chapter.
<br>

The primary lesson was utilizing a variety of css variables in the :root selector located in the styles.css sheet. This allows us to call the variables wherever in our css and change many colors with just 1 edit.
<br>

It utilizes a @media query to feature a responsive color-scheme to switch between a day/night image based on the size of the screen, by editing all the CSS variables if the max-width is less than 1000px.
