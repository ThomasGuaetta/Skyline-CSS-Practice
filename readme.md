<h1>Skyline CSS Practice</h1>
<p>This code was created as part of the [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) "Responsive Web Design" chapter.<br></p>


<p>The primary lesson learned was utilizing a variety of css variables in the :root selector located in the styles.css sheet. This allows us to call the variables wherever in our css and change many colors with just 1 edit.<br><p>

<p>It utilizes an @media query to feature a responsive color-scheme to switch between a day/night image based on the size of the screen, by editing all the CSS variables if the max-width is less than 1000px.<p>
